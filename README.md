#Calendar App - CIS*2750

This app was created for CIS*2750, a second year Software Systems Development & Integration course at University of Guelph.
This is an iCalendar application, meaning:

* It takes an .ics file as input, or lets you create your own
* Parses and validates the file
* Allows you to explore the file and modify some basic components (like Events)

Here's what it looks like
